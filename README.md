## 🔧 Key Features

- **True CoreXY kinematics**
- **Dual NEMA 17 stepper motors**
- **GT2 belt-driven motion**
- **Linear guide–based gantry (240 mm rails)**
- **Alignment-first mechanical design**
- **Explicit belt tensioning and squareness procedure**
- **Limit-switch-based homing**
- Designed for **manual assembly without precision metrology tools**

## 📐 Mechanical Overview

The CoreXY Set v2 uses a **cantilevered X-axis** supported by two Y-axis linear guides.  
Motor placement, pulley routing, and belt tensioning are designed to minimize racking and ensure repeatable motion.

⚠️ **Important design note**:  
The base plate is **not symmetrical**. Correct orientation must be verified before assembly.
